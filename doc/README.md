# Formats

* An IR-code is represented by a hexadecimal string with max value of FF I.e. 255.
* A trigger id is represented by a hexadecimal string with max value of FF I.e. 255.
* Time duration is represented by a hexadecimal string with max value of 15180 I.e. 86400. That is 24 hours. Duration unit is seconds.
  Examples:
  - Duration 1 hour is **E10** (3600 seconds)
  - Duration 3 hours is **2a30** (10800 seconds)
 * Time is represented by UTF8 string and has the format: hhmm.
   Examples:
   - Time: 09:30 is **0930**
   - Time: 17:45 is **1745**
 * Days of week are represented by a hexadecimal string with max value of FF I.e. 255. The hex needs to be converted to binary representation to get what days are represented. In binary most significant bit is Monday and least significant bit is Sunday.
   Examples:
   - All days of the week: Hex: **7F** = Binary: 1111111
   - Sunday and Monday: Hex: **41** = Binary: 1000001
   - Weekdays: Hex: **7C** = Binary: 1111100
   - Weekends: Hex: **3** = Binary: 0000011

  ## Trigger command
  General format: **[trigger-mode]-[trigger-id]**
  * A trigger command is a UTF8 String with maximum length of 20 characters (20 bytes).
  * A trigger command can have one of the 2 modes: _create_ or _delete_. Create is represented by the character **c**. Delete is represented by the character **d**.
  * A trigger command starts with trigger mode followed by trigger id and separated by the character **-**.
  * Examples:
    - Create a trigger with id 1: **c-1**
    - Create a trigger with id 123: **c-7b**
    - Delete a trigger with id 15: **d-f**

  ## Triggers from the app

### Comments

### Questions

## Requirement 1.13 <a name="req1.13"></a>
**The App will allow time windowed scheduling of IR code triggering**

### BLE Protocol
See 1.3

### Comments
The logic here is that if motion is detected and it is sufficiently strong to pass the threshold of the sensitivity setting and the time at which the motion occurs is within the time window (between the begin time and end time) then the IR code will be triggered. For example, I want to set up this device to turn on my air conditioner in the office during the weekdays Monday to Friday during office hours 9am to 5pm (the time window) and only if a person walks directly onto the room and not a person walking outside the office (hence sensitivity adjustmemt).

### Questions

## Requirement 1.14 <a name="req1.14"></a>
