UUID | TBD
Properties | WRITE, WRITE NO RESPONSE
Type | UTF-8 String

### Specification
"command:[schedule|delete];ircode:[numeric_code];days:[uint32(7 bits)];window1:[hhmm];window2:[hhmm|-1]"

Example 1: Trigger IR code 1, every Monday and Friday, at 18:00

The app would send the string:
"command:schedule;ircode:1;days:68;window1:1800;window2:-1"

Example 2: Trigger IR code 4, everyday, at 23:15

The app would send the string:
"command:schedule;ircode:4;days:127;window1:2315;window2:-1"

Example 3: Trigger IR code 16, weekdays, within 09:00 to 17:00

The app would send the string:
"command:schedule;ircode:16;days:124;window1:0900;window2:1700"

Example 4: Delete IR code 4, everyday, at 23:15

The app would send the string:
"command:delete;ircode:4;days:127;window1:2315;window2:-1"

### Comments

- Supports time and days of week.
- Example: Turn on air conditioner every weekday on 7:00 am.
- We need a command to disable/erase a schedule.

The App tells the Device:
- What IR code to trigger
- When to trigger it

### Questions

## Requirement 1.4 <a name="req1.4"></a>
**The App will allow the motion sensor sensitivity to be set**

### BLE Protocol

Custom characteristic | -
--- | ---
Name | Motion sensor sensitivity
UUID | TBD
Properties | WRITE, WRITE NO RESPONSE
Type | uint32

### Comments

### Questions
What are the possible values for sensor sensitivity?

## Requirement 1.5 <a name="req1.5"></a>
**The App will allow a timeout to be set (to turn off the air conditioner if no motion is sensed for a while)**

### BLE Protocol

Custom characteristic | -
--- | ---
Name | Motion sensor timeout
UUID | TBD
Properties | WRITE, WRITE NO RESPONSE
Type | uint32

### Specification
- Timeout duration in seconds (max value: 24 hours = 86400 seconds): 17 bits 
- Ir code: 6 bits (64 possible IR codes)
- Days: 7 bits
- Total: 30 bits

Example: Emit IR code X every day if no motion is sensed for 2 minutes
- IR code X: 000001
- Every day: 1111111
- 2 minutes(120 seconds): 1111000
- => The app would send: 991169

### Comments
- We need a command to disable/erase a schedule.
- The App tells the Device the timeout value.
- The App tells the Device what IR code to emit when timeout value is reached.
- The App tells at what days the timeout is valid

### Questions

## Requirement 1.6 <a name="req1.6"></a>
**The App will allow the air conditioner to be controlled manually using buttons in the App (for testing purposes mainly)**

### BLE Protocol
Same as 1.2

### Comments
- Completely handled by the App. Given that IR control signals have been learned.

Type | uint16

### Comments

### Questions
- Why is a custom characteristic needed? Isnâ€™t it enough with the Battery service?

### Comments

### Questions

## Requirement 1.13 <a name="req1.13"></a>
**The App will allow time windowed scheduling of IR code triggering**

### BLE Protocol
See 1.3

### Comments
The logic here is that if motion is detected and it is sufficiently strong to pass the threshold of the sensitivity setting and the time at which the motion occurs is within the time window (between the begin time and end time) then the IR code will be triggered. For example, I want to set up this device to turn on my air conditioner in the office during the weekdays Monday to Friday during office hours 9am to 5pm (the time window) and only if a person walks directly onto the room and not a person walking outside the office (hence sensitivity adjustmemt).
